# Branch-dependent output boundaries

This module records the finite public branching at the output of a typed LOCC program.  Leaves carry
multipartite systems, while public nodes retain the announced value that selects the remaining
boundary.

namespace TypedLOCC

variable {P : Type} [Fintype P] [DecidableEq P]

/-- A finite public tree of possible output multipartite systems.

The public constructor represents the measurement-history tree used for finite-round LOCC in
Chitambar--Leung--Mančinska--Ozols--Winter, arXiv:1210.4583, Section II: later local instruments may
depend on the already announced outcomes.  This type records only that public control flow; quantum
actions are carried separately by `Program`.

This includes every declared public label, whether or not a particular program can physically
reach that label.

/-- The finite classical-quantum output space associated with a boundary.

An exit identifies a declared public branch, and its fibre is the joint quantum register at that
branch's final multipartite system. This is a syntactic output space and need not be the reachable
support of a particular program.

/-- **A boundary that declares a complete public exit has a nonempty output space.**

The fibre over an exit is a `MultipartiteSystem.total`, which is always inhabited, so the only way
the output space of a syntactic boundary can be empty is for the boundary to declare no exit at all
— as `Boundary.announce Empty` does.  Nothing here asserts that every boundary has an exit; the
hypothesis `Nonempty B.Exit` must be supplied, and for a concrete protocol it is a theorem about
that protocol's construction. -/
