# Completeness of the binomial PE-pass mass at a shifted true rate

`Math.Concentration.BinomialPassSum.one_sub_binomialPassSum_le_two_hoeffding` bounds the
band-fail mass **only at the band centre**, `p = Q`.  A de Finetti component that merely *lies in*
the parameter-estimation band carries a true per-trial rate `p` somewhere inside it, not exactly at
its centre, so the centre-only bound says nothing about it.  This file supplies the band-uniform
completeness bound: a true rate anywhere in the shrunken band `|p − Q| ≤ δ − η` fails the band
`|k/m − Q| ≤ δ` with mass at most `2·exp(−2mη²)`, an exponent that does **not** degrade as `p`
moves across the shrunken band.

## Main statements

- `one_sub_binomialPassSum_le_two_hoeffding_of_mem_band`: `|p − Q| ≤ δ − η` implies
  `1 − binomialPassSum m Q δ p ≤ 2·exp(−2mη²)`, uniformly in `p` over the shrunken band.
- `one_sub_binomialPassSum_le_two_hoeffding_of_halfBand`: the half-band instance `η = δ/2`,
  `|p − Q| ≤ δ/2` implies `1 − binomialPassSum m Q δ p ≤ 2·exp(−m·δ²/2)`.
- `binomialPassSum_ge_one_sub_two_hoeffding_of_halfBand`: the same as an explicit **lower** bound on
  the pass mass, the direction a positive accept-weight argument consumes.

The centre-only bound `one_sub_binomialPassSum_le_two_hoeffding` is the `η = δ` case (the shrunken
band `|p − Q| ≤ 0` pins `p = Q`); nothing here weakens it.

The engine is the same as in the centre-only file: `binomial_two_tail_le` at the tails
`k/m ≤ p − η` and `p + η ≤ k/m` **around the true rate `p`**, not around `Q`.  Only the
indicator-domination step changes: outside the band `|k/m − Q| ≤ δ`, the empirical fraction is at
distance more than `δ − |p − Q| ≥ η` from `p`.

/-- **Band-uniform completeness bound on the PE-pass mass.**

If the true per-trial rate `p ∈ [0,1]` lies in the band `|k/m − Q| ≤ δ` shrunk by a margin `η > 0`
(that is `|p − Q| ≤ δ − η`), then the binomial mass that **fails** the band is at most
`2·exp(−2mη²)`:

`1 − binomialPassSum m Q δ p ≤ 2·exp(−2·m·η²)`.

The exponent depends on `p` only through the hypothesis, so the bound is uniform in `p` over the
shrunken band — this is what distinguishes it from `one_sub_binomialPassSum_le_two_hoeffding`,
which holds only at the exact centre `p = Q`.

Mechanism: failing the band means `k/m > Q + δ` or `k/m < Q − δ`; combined with
`Q − (δ − η) ≤ p ≤ Q + (δ − η)` this puts `k/m` in one of the two Hoeffding tails **at the true
rate** `p`, at margin `η` on each side, and `binomial_two_tail_le` charges `exp(−2mη²)` to each.
Complementing against `binomialWeight_sum_eq_one` turns the fail bound into the pass bound. -/

/-- **Half-band completeness bound on the PE-pass mass.**

The `η = δ/2` instance of `one_sub_binomialPassSum_le_two_hoeffding_of_mem_band`: a true per-trial
rate within `δ/2` of the band centre fails the band `|k/m − Q| ≤ δ` with mass at most
`2·exp(−m·δ²/2)`.

Half of the band width is spent buying the margin, so the exponent is a quarter of the centre-only
one (`2mδ²` at `p = Q`); what is bought is that the bound holds **uniformly** for every `p` in the
half-band rather than at the single point `p = Q`. -/

/-- **Half-band lower bound on the PE-pass mass.**

The pass-mass form of `one_sub_binomialPassSum_le_two_hoeffding_of_halfBand`: for a true per-trial
rate within `δ/2` of the band centre,

`binomialPassSum m Q δ p ≥ 1 − 2·exp(−m·δ²/2)`.

This is the direction a positive accept-weight argument consumes: it certifies that a component
sitting anywhere in the half-band contributes at least a constant share of its mass to the accept
event, uniformly in its position within the half-band. -/
