# Haar Measure on the Unitary Group — compactness, Borel σ-algebra, probability measure

Topological and measure-theoretic infrastructure for the unitary group U(d).

## Main definitions
- `haarOnUnitary`: Unnormalized Haar measure on U(d)

## Main statements
- `instCompactSpaceUnitaryGroup`: U(d) is compact
- `haarProbUnitary_isProbability`: The normalized measure is a probability measure

/-- **The Haar measure on the compact unitary group `U(d)` is right-invariant.**

Compact groups are unimodular: the left Haar measure is also right-invariant.  On `U(d)`
(compact, Hausdorff, second-countable) the right-translate `μ ∘ (· * g)` is itself a
left-invariant measure finite on compacts, hence a scalar multiple of `μ` by uniqueness of
Haar measure on a compact space; the scalar is forced to `1` because right translation is a
measurable automorphism preserving the total (finite) mass.  This is the analytic input that
makes `U(d)`-Haar averages invariant under the substitution `U ↦ U·W`, the right-translation
companion of the left-invariance already used in this development. -/
