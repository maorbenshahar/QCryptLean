# An explicit ball floor for the Haar first-column measure on the unit sphere of `ℂ^D`

Pushing the normalised Haar measure of `U(D)` forward along `U ↦ U e₀` (the first column) gives a
probability measure `haarFirstColumnMeasure D` supported on the unit sphere of
`EuclideanSpace ℂ (Fin D)`.  Two structural facts pin its ball masses from below without any
identification of the measure:

* it is invariant under the `U(D)`-action on `EuclideanSpace ℂ (Fin D)`, because Haar measure is
  left invariant and `firstColumn (V * U) = V • firstColumn U`;
* `U(D)` acts transitively on the unit sphere, because every unit vector is the first column of
  some unitary matrix.

Hence all closed balls of a fixed radius centred on the sphere carry the same mass, and covering
the sphere by `N` such balls forces each to carry at least `1/N`.  Combined with the volumetric
covering count `Math.VolumetricPacking.exists_isCover_card_le`, this yields the explicit floor
`(1 + 2/r)^(-2D) ≤ haarFirstColumnMeasure D (closedBall x r)`.

The covering argument is the one in Vershynin, *High-Dimensional Probability* (CUP 2018), §4.2;
the Haar first-column construction is the one CKR use for the reference state,
arXiv:0809.3019, `main.tex:307-316`.

## Main definitions

- `Math.HaarSphere.firstColumn`: the first column of a unitary matrix as a Euclidean vector.
- `Math.HaarSphere.haarFirstColumnMeasure`: its Haar pushforward.

## Main statements

- `Math.HaarSphere.haarFirstColumnMeasure_closedBall_eq`: all radius-`r` closed balls centred on
  the unit sphere have equal mass.
- `Math.HaarSphere.haarFirstColumnMeasure_closedBall_ge`: the explicit floor
  `(1 + 2/r)^(-2D)`.
